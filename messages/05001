message:
    Refusing to fetch into current branch %s of non-bare repository

description:
    You tried to fetch commits directly into your current branch. This is
    dangerous because the branch would diverge from your working tree and
    you'd have a mess. Instead, fetch the branch into FETCH_HEAD or into one
    of the remote tracking branches.
